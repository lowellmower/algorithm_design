### About:
This poorly named repository was originally intended to be a thorough reading of [Skiena's Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=skiena+algorithm+design+manual&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=177234932584&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12992417675248320985&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=e&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9002292&hvtargid=kwd-34266377750&ref=pd_sl_9dkfr84cbx_e) but has more organically turned into a place to track interesting problems and a place to "scratch an itch".

In my day to day I encounter intriguing topics, typically in conversations with co-workers, which I desire to document and practice. In addition to aforementioned documentation and practice, I've acquired a fondness for solving fabricated programming problems or "interview questions" and seek to employ this repository to serve those means also.

What can be found here is by no means meant to be an example of the best possible solution, both in time and space respectively. Rather, these examples are a vignette for my future self; a connection for my future self to the engineer in the present.

Enjoy.
